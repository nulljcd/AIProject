# machineLearning
Exporing machine learning.

### I plan to implement:
- neural network (NN)
- deep genetic algorithm (DeepGA), neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT)
- back propagation
- stochastic gradient descent (SDG), adaptable moment estimation (ADAM) and other learning acceration techniques
- proximal policy optimization (PPO)

### notes
- I plan to make it easily portable to any lang, so I have to sacrifice numPy
- meant to be easy to understand, so not many optimizations
